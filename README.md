# Text to Array

This is a very simple program that will convert a list of words into an array. This may be useful when you have a list of names, or something else.

Usage is very simple, you just write or paste your text when prompted. For example, you could write:
x y z
and the returned text will be [x, y, z]

Simple as that!
