# Text to Array

This is a very simple program that will convert a list of words into an array.

All you need to do is make sure there is a space between all your words, and the program will do the rest.

# Instructions

Usage is very simple, you just write or paste your text when prompted. For example, you could write:
x y z and the returned text will be [x, y, z]

### Windows

If you're on windows, go into the Command Prompt and type the following:

    pip install clipboard

If that doesn't work, and it gives you an error that says:

    pip: command not found

Try this instead:

    pip3 install clipboard


Once you have that done, you can use the program!

### MacOS

MacOS is much simpler than Windows. You don't need to install anything, you can just jump right into the program!
