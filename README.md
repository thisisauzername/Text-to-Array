# Text to Array

This is a very simple program that will convert a list of words into an array.

The only thing that is required is that the words are separated with a space. Other than that, you're good to go!

Usage is very simple, you just write or paste your text when prompted. For example, you could write:
x y z and the returned text will be [x, y, z]

Simple as that!
